This model evaluates the ausferrite kinetics according to boccardo's model. The final volume fraction (at ambient temperature) is predicted by it model.

-Main program: ausferrite_main.m

-Subroutines: *F.m (Boccardo's functions)
              *Bha.m (Bhadeshia's functions that were both translated from Fortran to Octave and modify by Boccardo)
