This model evaluates the ausferrite kinetics according to boccardo's model:

Ausferritic Transformation of Austempered Ductile Irons. Metall Mater Trans A 48,
524â€“535 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11661-016-3816-9


-Main program: ausferrite_main.m

-Subroutines: *F.m (Boccardo's functions)
              *Bha.m (Bhadeshia's functions that were both translated from Fortran to Octave and modify by Boccardo)
